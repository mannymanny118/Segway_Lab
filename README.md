# Segway_Lab
segway_equations pdf shows calculations used to form odes.
segode and segode2 are state-space representations of the equations calculated in the seway_equations pdf
segway_m are where odes are solved and the gain K_lqr is calculated. The file also runs seglinear and segnonlinear Simulink Models to simulate the Segway's response
segway_system Simulink model runs on Audrino Mega that balances the segway.
segvideo files show the segway balancing for 30 seconds
